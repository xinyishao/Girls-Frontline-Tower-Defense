# Girls' Frontline Tower Defense

## Description
This game is developed by different design patterns and multi-thread programming by Java. 
(Since I did not implement GPU programming or Frame synchronization, the game may use a lot of resources.)
The frontend is developed by my teammates to apply JavaFX for event-driven programming using the sprites from Girls 
Frontline.

## Installation
Clone or import to your IDE or text editor, and add 'assets' as resource folder
(If you use IDEA or Eclipse, you can skip the second step)

## Running
Find ```src/view_control/Main``` to run the game
